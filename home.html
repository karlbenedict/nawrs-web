				The <em>Native American Water Rights Settlement</em> (NAWRS) project is a long-term collaboration between UNM's <a href="http://uttoncenter.unm.edu/">Utton Transboundary Resources Center</a> and <a href="http://library.unm.edu">University Libraries</a>, the <a href="http://ailc-inc.org/index.htm">American Indian Law Center, Inc.</a>, and the <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/law">Law School at the University of Idaho</a>. The project has focused on the development of a growing collection of documents that formalize recognition of Native American water rights in the United States and developing innovated approaches for discovering documents within the collection. This document collection is intended to both serve as a consolidated reference for documents related to specific water rights settlements, but to also serve as a reference for informing the development of new settlements. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
				The document collection is maintained within <a href="http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nawrs/">UNM's institutional repository</a> (IR) through which the documents can be located using basic textual search queries against the extensive documentation (metadata) that has been created for each document in the collection. A significant focus of the NAWRS development efforts since 2011 has been to extend the capabilities for discovering these documents beyond standard text searching. A prototype map interface for displaying the geographic locations of documents in the collection was released in 2013. In 2016-2017 a new <a href="http://www.nawrs.net/nawrs">map-based interface</a> was developed that uses detailed geographic information that is embedded within the documentation for each document in UNM's IR to allow for combined text-based and <em>spatial</em> searches for documents in the collection. These searches allow for sophisticated discovery of documents based on a combination of geographies including <em>tribal boundaries</em>, <em>watershed regions</em>, and <em>US state boundaries</em>. This spatial search capability allows for the discovery of documents based on their specific location, and visualization of the geographic locations that relate to those documents - independent of the specific textual keywords that might (or might not) be embedded in those documents that relate to location names. This capability allows for the extension of spatial searches to new geographic regions without having to update the documentation managed within the IR. This flexible search capability is intended to provide the foundation for continued development and expansion of the capabilities for discovering and accessing this important collection of documents.
